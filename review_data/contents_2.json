Also the only option for recording audio is via the device mic so you get all other ambient audio as well. I would like to be able to record the clean application audio and add my own audio voice track over it later if needed.   2)I think it may be because you have to use the mic to record audio, but when played back the audio is out of sync with the video by a couple of seconds. This is on ANY video I make with it. I know it's not the media player on my Note 10.1 as I also played it on the PC in VLC and the audio is still out of sync.  3)The last issue I have with it deals with the orientation of recorded video. My battery was low on my tablet so I wanted to have it plugged in while playing. I rotated the device so the power connector was facing up so I could have it standing up while plugged in.
