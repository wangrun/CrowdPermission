That's right, it consumed more data than all of my other apps combined.  Fortunately, I had my data limit set so I didn't have to pay any data overages, but it did mean that I had to do without data for the last few days of my billing cycle.  Turning off background data had absolutely no effect on the data usage--this app treats all the data as foreground data.   Why would a 20MB app need to consume so much of my data plan?  I have no idea.  Unfortunately, Android doesn't report whether the data usage was in download or uploads.  I shudder at the possibilities.
