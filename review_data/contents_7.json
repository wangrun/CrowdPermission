That is a ridiculous amount of time to restore text messages.  By the way, I am ONLY talking about SMS messages now.  I am NOT also restoring MMS messages, nor am I restoring anything else at all.  Other dislike that I've gotten tired of disliking (in other words, I had to just accept it even though I don't like it) is that when I backed up my applications (such as games) and restored them, NONE of the progress in the games were restored...no high scores, no acquired items, no achieved levels...nothing.

Hopefully it gets faster, too ", " Have to admit that I'm quite disappointed with this app. I honestly have no qualms with paying a subscription as it's cheap enough but my gripe is with the fact DeskSMS/TabletSMS doesn't seem to support concatenated multi SMS messages and will only display part of such messages. For me this is a major issue because I like to text in proper English, a behaviour also encouraged by modern day smartphone/tablet keyboards. Emailed the developer to ask for help regarding this issue but never received a reply. ", " A very reliable product. I have been using Tablet SMS for a while now, and I have not missed a text. ", " Very good. It does exactlly what it says. I have only found one glitch so far. If I make a mistake while typing a text  I cant delete the t44xt past a period. Also a way to import contacts from a smart phone would be very conveinent. Orherwise well worth the time ", " I wanted my tablet to work much like my cell phone. The ability to send and receive texts that is unified with my phone is great.  This is perfect for those who have Wi-Fi tablets but want cellular data features.   The only thing lacking now is my ability to make calls through my phone via my tablet.

Now, you can leave the phone to charge and still make your plans via text. Fantastic! ", " Easy to set up &amp; works as advertised. Had a similar SMS gateway function with the OEM firmware on my phone which would let you send an SMS from Outlook but it vanished when I installed a custom ROM.  This App, it's phone counterpart (DeskSMS) &amp; the Chrome plugin have re-instated the ability to send an SMS from my desktop &amp; extended the flexibility to my tablet too.

If not for those issues this app is an easy 5/5. ", " Been using this app for almost a year now... No complaints, just works. Sometimes you have to logout and login again to get things working again but that's once every few months and not even annoying. ", " used DeskSMS since it's inception and was fairly happy with it, but this blows it out of the water. little to no lag in texting, have yet to have any hanging messages, and an awesome interface to go along with it. I'd recommend this to any tablet user who doesn't want to have to juggle multiple devices. Also saves my phone battery for longer use throughout the day since I'm not constantly turning the screen on to respond to messages. There's really nothing bad I can say about this app. ", " I should have download this ages ago! Sure beats having two gadgets out- especially when in a meeting! And, when I had my phone out for a week....I REALLY wished I had downloaded this and DeskSMS prior. ", " But I can't figure out why it's emailing me the SMS mags? ", " This is a TRIAL app. It doesn't say that. It doesn't warn you that its a trial. It just stops working one day and tells you you have to subscribe. For that reason alone, it has earned the lowest rating possible. There's nothing wrong with making an app a trial app; but at least tell us! The app itself is nothing special. It forwards the texts with the phone number, and if you want to take the time to add the email address it assigns each number it will match up to your contacts. But you have to do that manually. It also is text message only (no MMS) and won't sync up any texts you send from your phone. So in summary: very basic feature set, nothing special; hidden trial; you can find much better apps out there. ", " Quick, fast, small memory footprint on the tablet. Within seconds had populated the app with my text messages and synced contacts. Fast, simple, brilliant! (And I've tried HEAPS of different tablet texting apps.)

Occasional sync issues, resolved with re-log in, takes away one star. ", " You know that feeling you get when your phone goes ping as a message arrives and your phone is in another room........ No problem with TabletSMS on my Nexus 7 or Asus Transformer as one of them is usually to hand. ", " I'm not the most android savvy user so I was delighted to find that this app works like a charm. Easy setup and reliably receives all my text messages. No need to text using my phone's tiny screen anymore. ", " I completely love this app it works amazing with my phone and tablet and saves my phone life cause I'm not on my phone as much ", " Let's me reply to texts even when the phone's not around (rare occasions, but still) ", " I really wanna pay for desk SMS cause my trial is almost up but tabletsms isn't consistent. I get a lot of failed messages now. Was really fast and great first few days \ud83d\ude15 ", " Was hoping for more.  Especially as it appears they will charge me for the app after 2 weeks.  Essentially, it does not display any text conversations.  Perhaps there is a setting that needs to be adjusted but I cannot find it.  Another app,  MightText, displays my text conversations from the start.  While sluggish to update,  it is free and displays text conversations where as TabletSMS just displays the last message in the text listings.  Needless to say,  this is an Uninstall. ", " it works amazing but if you have your phone near you then it may seem silly cause you get a notification on both devices so thats two devices either making noise or vibrating. i just got it so i dont know if thats fixable yet but otherwise its fun now we just need one for phone calls..

I can't find an option to change the text color or contrast so I can actually see the text. White text on white background makes it pretty hard to see ", " I wasn't all that impressed with how it worked on my Google Nexus 7. Only sometimes received messages. Never could get attachments to open. Interface of actual texting software is lacking. ", " If you use your tablet most of the time it's a must. I can set my phone down and not touch it all night. Get all my texts on the tablet ", " Love it. I am I on my tablet more than my cell and I was missing texts people sent so now I can do both on the same device. Wandering if there is a way to attach a photo to text ans send. When I click on th ed share icon the drop down menu does have this app as an option to send photo? Definetly worth downloading! ", " I have the new Nexus 7, i can't figure out how to send MMS from this?  When i click on what looks like the attach button on the top right it only gives me options for \"drive\" or \"contacts\".  How do you send pictures with this app?  Once i find that out 5 stars and will buy it but until then i need to find something i can send pictures from my new nexus 7.

Even if Caller ID is not blocked, often the original caller's number, rather than the number of the phone that you are forwarding, is passed through and the caller is asked to enter a 14 digit PIN.  A workaround would be to forward all your phones (cell and landline) to a Google Voice number. In GV settings select \"Display my Google Voice number\" rather than \"Display caller's number,\" so Keku will always see a valid Caller ID. Forward the Google Voice number to Keku and forward the Keku number to your international phone number.  External callers could also be told to call your GV number rather than your cell phone or landline. You cannot have external callers call your Keku incoming number, it only works from registered phone numbers because it uses Caller ID to know where to route incoming calls from the shared incoming numbers.
