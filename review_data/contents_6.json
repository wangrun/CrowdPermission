However, it regularly crashes my phone. I have to restart by re-inserting the battery. No other app does the same. I've tested it by just using the program and shutting it down. Not sure what's causing it. It might just be a function of having a less-common device. Because of this, I've stopped using it and just use the Evernote app instead.  Keep at it! It's a great idea, and I would use it multiple times per week after some improvements. I'd even pay for it. [Gasp!]  Cheers.
