On the mobile phone I like the notifications and the easy way of confirming going to events on all platforms, and the integration with TripIt.  What I don't like about the Android version, and where I find that other calendars such as aCalendar excel, is that there is no month view, and the week view is almost unusable because the day stretches too much.
